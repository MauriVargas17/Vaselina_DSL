# Vaselina
## What is Vaselina?

Vaselina is a Domain Specific Language developed as the final project of
the class: "Compilación" at Universidad Privada Boliviana. It is compiled
to Java through Xtext and Xtend. 

## Features
### Data Types
Vaselina has 4 data types:
- Numb (Entumecido) = Number
- Strange (Extraño) = String
- Bull () = Bool
- Dribble () = Double

### Functions 
Functions can be given values to keep or not!

## Strenghts

Vaselina handles a funny, rather understandable sytnax, specially for those
starting in programming. Beyond the constraints of the project, there is a 
good use of most basic components in any programming language. It includes 
a grammar with operation precedence, making type synthesis an easier task.
Opens options to include plenty of so-called Standard Functions in order to
benefit from Java's endless possibilities.

## Limitations

Vaselina is not an Object Oriented Programming Language. It lacks several
Java features and does not take full advantage of it's libraries. It lacks
scoping, as probably one of the saddest absences.
